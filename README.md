# Newsletter Sign Up with Success Message

This project is a solution to the "Newsletter Sign Up with Success Message" challenge from Frontend Mentor. The challenge is to build a newsletter sign-up form that allows users to input their email, submit the form, and see a success message with their email after successful submission. Additionally, the form should provide validation messages if the field is left empty or if the email address is not formatted correctly. The layout should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, and interactive elements should have hover and focus states.
